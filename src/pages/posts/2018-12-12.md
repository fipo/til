Usually I have to start dev server and tests in different tabs in the terminal, but how awesome and useful would it be to have only one script for that.

Well, today [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) teach me an awesome solution for that in one of the lessons at [Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/lessons/egghead-scripting-cypress-for-local-development-and-continuous-integration):  [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) from [@bahmutov](https://twitter.com/bahmutov).

_package.json_
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --watch",
  "test:run": "start-server-and-test start:dev http://localhost:8080 test"
  "start:dev": "webpack-dev-server"
}
 ```
So basically when I run `yarn test:run`, `start-server-and-test` run the first parameter - `start:dev` and wait for the server to start responding. When this happens it will run the third parameter - `test`.

This is very useful not only for the developer but for the CI too.
