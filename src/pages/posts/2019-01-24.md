It's not something new but I think will be useful to share.

As you already know, ***environment variables*** are very useful on every system. It's allowing us to free our software from configuration dependencies.

In the Node.js world is very common to start the server with:

```
$ NODE_ENV=development node server.js
```

This is ok, but when env vars grow it's not that fun ;)

So, there is better way how to organize the configuration - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):

1. install the [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
2. create `.env` file
3. put all the configurations there

      ```shell
      NODE_ENV=development
      PORT=3000
      ...
      ```

4. configure the package

      ```javascript
      // Easy
      require('dotenv').config(); //will try to open .env in the root
      console.log(process.env.PORT) //returns 3000
      ```

      ```javascript
      // More flexible
      const dotenv = require('dotenv');

      //optional: Pass the path to the configuration. Default is .env file in the root
      const result = dotenv.config({ path: './.production.env' }) 

      //you can check if the config is found
      if (result.error) {
        throw result.error
      }

      console.log(result); //returns { parsed: {PORT: '3000'}}

      console.log(process.env.PORT) //returns 3000
      ```

5. Pro tip: Create `.env.example` and add `.env` in `.gitignore`. Every dev should copy example file and add personal configs.

Please check out the [documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/master/README.md) for detailed info about configuration.

This topic is well explained from [@John_Papa](https://twitter.com/John_Papa) in his article [Node.js Everywhere with Environment Variables!](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/making-your-node-js-work-everywhere-with-environment-variables-2da8cdf6e786)

Cheers ;)
