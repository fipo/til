This was initially taught me [Deyan Yanakiev](https://medium.com/@deyanyanakiev) when we work together on TS project with growing complexity. After that I saw that this approach isn't very popular, so I decide to share it.

So when any project grow, the complexity grows too. In many times we will find ourselves traveling up and down in the filesystem trying to load Components from the right place.

In many projects this looks perfectly fine:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { util } from './../../common/util';
import Component from './../../../components/Component';
```

It's easy to lost ourselves in this, especially when we doing some refactoring.

Be hold! There is a better way to organize complicated imports without introducing a new dependencies:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { util } from 'common/util';
import Component from 'components/Component';
```

## Webpack

Webpack have this awesome config property [resolve.alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias) which allow us to create aliases like:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const sourcePath = path.join(__dirname, './src');
module.exports = () => {
  ...
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js'],
    alias: {
      'common': path.join(sourcePath, 'common'),
      'components': path.join(sourcePath, 'components'),
      'service': path.join(sourcePath, 'service'),
      'utils': path.join(sourcePath, 'utils'),
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

this config will allow us to replace unknown count of `../` to alias ... pretty neat right ;)

## VSCode or other editor

Unfortunately the first thing what you'll face is that VSCode will fail to recognize the alias and will trow an error.

Update your `tsconfig.json` like this (ref.: [visualstudio.com/docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig#_using-webpack-aliases)):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "common/*": ["./src/common/*"],
      "components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
      "service/*": ["./src/service/*"],
      "utils/*": ["./src/utils/*"],
    }
  }
}
```
## Jest
